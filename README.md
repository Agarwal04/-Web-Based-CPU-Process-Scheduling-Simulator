# -Web-Based-CPU-Process-Scheduling-Simulator
 Designed and developed a web-based CPU scheduling simulator to visually demonstrate key operating system algorithms.
 The simulator allows users to input process details, view Gantt chart visualizations, and analyze performance metrics.
 The project followed a complete SDLC approachâ€”from requirement analysis and UI design to algorithm implementation, visualization, testing, and deployment.
